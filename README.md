**🚀 rawIP — Advanced IP Generator Tool**

**USE WITH MY HEXTRACER TOOL, TO SEE IF THE IP'S ARE VALID!**

**Features:**

🌐 **Bulk IP Generation** — Instantly generates a huge list of IP addresses for your projects, testing, or just messing around.

✅ **Mostly Valid IPs** — Many generated IPs are valid and usable, but beware: some might appear valid even if they aren’t 100% accurate. Use with caution!

🔗 **Webhook Integration (Highly Recommended!)** — Send all generated valid IPs directly to your Discord webhook for smooth, automated, real-time logging. This is the *best* way to collect and organize your data.

⚠️ **Console Output Fallback** — If you don’t provide a webhook (not recommended), rawIP will output IPs to the console. But heads up — this might be less convenient and harder to manage. For an optimal user experience, always use a webhook!

📩 **Built-in Embed Support** — Automatically formats messages with sleek Discord embeds, making your IP logs look clean, professional, and easy to read.

⚡ **Lightweight & Efficient** — Designed for speed and simplicity, rawIP runs smoothly without hogging resources or slowing down your system.

🛠️ **Easy to Use** — Simple setup and straightforward commands, perfect for both beginners and advanced users alike.
